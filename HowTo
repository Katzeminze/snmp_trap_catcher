For SNMP trap you need to download snmpd, snmptrapd, snmptt etc.

Add the following string to the snmptrapd.conf:
traphandle default /home/kate/Documents/snmptrapCatcher.sh instead of default one.

Add to your crontab path to the file send_trap.sh if you want to sent a trap more than one time. 

snmpTrapCatcher.sh will catch the trap and then it to IOTServer.
